# LINE-FOLLOWER-ROBOT-USING-IC-L293D
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an autonomous Line Follower Robot that detects and follows a predefined path using IR sensors. The robot uses the L293D motor driver IC to control DC motors based on real-time sensor inputs. The project focuses on core concepts of robotics, embedded systems, and motor control.
