# LINE-FOLLOWER-ROBOT-USING-IC-L293D
Overview

This project presents the design and implementation of an autonomous line follower robot using IR sensors and the L293D dual H-bridge motor driver IC. The robot follows a predefined path by continuously sensing line position and controlling DC motor movement through real-time hardware logic.

System Architecture :- 


Sensing Unit: IR sensors for line detection.

Control Logic: Hardware-based decision logic for movement direction.

Actuation Unit: DC motors driven via L293D H-bridge IC.

Power Unit: Regulated DC supply for motors and sensors.


Functional Description:-
